[permut.co](http://permut.co) – Web project on information theory, graph patterns, permutations, and recombinations

> `(478)(356) ⪯ `:computer:

### Aims:
- self-hosted: first project on own server
- built with Structr and parallel Neo4j
- design and form graph database of concepts (named entities as well as Wiki-structured map)

### Long term goals:
- management of abstract/deep connections inferred through a hypergraph database on top of Neo4j
  - study own and/or user learning/attention processes ('explanatory' modelling)
  - machine learning models (TensorFlow)
- offline RDF analysis: concept graph enrichment/structuring

### Research-assistive application:
- Biological research-oriented spin-off with the same format, use of biological linked data ("[ontologies](http://obofoundry.org)")

- see: [Wiki](https://github.com/lmmx/copermut/wiki) consolidating readings and discussions of {category,graph,order} theory, {geometric,linear,matrix} algebra, {ML,DL,NLP} — _etc._ — as imaginative routes and progressive community resource in systems biology, genomic statistics, and their surrounding communities in the computer, life, and physical sciences.
